- 👋 Hi, I’m Jhavakar
- 👀 I’m interested in Software development, working in the front-end development role. As I grow I know I want to understand and learn Backend Development and become a Full Stack Developer. I know I will and aim to succeed. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other people who have experience in the field and learn from them, that way I know where I am at and what I need to achieve to get to the role they are at.
